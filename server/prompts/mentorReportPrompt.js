Taking cooking classes before we volunteer at willing hearts enables us to increase the quality of what we help make in willing hearts. Not only will this be helpful for us when we volunteer, but it also will be useful in the long run when we go to university and move out of our homes. When volunteering in Willing Hearts, we will be helping to prepare, cook, pack meals, or clean. Some of the beneficiaries of these meals include low-income families, the elderly, migrant workers, as well as poverty-stricken families.
